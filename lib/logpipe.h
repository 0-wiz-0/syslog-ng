/**
 *
 * Processing pipeline
 *
 *   Within syslog-ng, the user configuration is converted into a tree-like
 *   structure.  It's node in this tree is a LogPipe object responsible for
 *   queueing message towards the destination.  Each node is free to
 *   drop/transform the message it receives.
 *
 *   The center.c module contains code that transforms the configuration
 *   into the log processing tree.  Each log statement in user configuration
 *   becomes a linked list of pipes, then each source, referenced by the
 *   is piped into the newly created pipe.
 *
 *   Something like this:
 *
 *    log statement:
 *       mpx | filter | parser | dest1 | dest2 | dest3
 *
 *    source1 -> log statement1
 *            |-> log statement2
 *
 *   E.g. each source is sending to each log path it was referenced from. Each
 *   item in the log path is a pipe, which receives messages and forwards it
 *   at its discretion. Filters are pipes too, which lose data. Destinations
 *   are piping their output to the next element on the pipeline. This
 *   basically means that the pipeline is a wired representation of the user
 *   configuration without having to loop through configuration data.
 *
 * Reference counting
 *
 *   The pipes do not reference each other through their pipe_next member,
 *   simply because there'd be too much reference loops to care about.
 *   Instead pipe_next is a borrowed reference, which is assumed to be valid
 *   as long as the configuration is not freed.
