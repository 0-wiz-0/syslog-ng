3.1beta2
        Fri, 18 Dec 2009 09:19:39 +0100

        Bugfixes:
        * Fixed two major memory leaks, one on input messages, one in
          patterndb.
        * Fixed escaped structured data processing.
        * Fixed expanding SDATA references in templates which have multiple
          dots in its name (e.g. when an OID is present in the name of the
          SD param or SD-ID.
        * pdbtool now correctly zero pads month and day fields in publish
          date of the merged patterndb file.
        * pdbtool won't link to unnecessary libraries, which fixes a
          compilation problem on Solaris with flex installed.


3.1beta1
        Sun, 29 Nov 2009 16:25:18 +0100

        This is the first public release of syslog-ng Open Source Edition 3.1.

        syslog-ng 3.1 is the first so called "feature release" of syslog-ng,
        as such its support period ends when either the next feature (named
        3.2) or the next stable (named 4.0) version is published.

        New features:
        * Support for patterndb v2 and v3 format, along with a bunch of new
          parsers: ANYSTRING, IPv6, IPvANY and FLOAT.

        * Added a new "pdbtool" utility to manage patterndb files: convert
          them from v1 or v2 format, merge mulitple patterndb files into one
          and look up matching patterns given a specific message.

        * Support for message tags: tags can be assigned to log messages as
          they enter syslog-ng: either by the source driver or via patterndb.
          Later it these tags can be used for efficient filtering.

        * Added support for rewriting structured data.

        * Macros and name-value pairs got a little tighter integration,
          in filters where syslog-ng 3.0 was limited to only use name-value
          pairs, with 3.1 you can also use macros.

        * Enhanced dynamic name-value performance by a factor of three.

        * Some parsers got additional features: NUMBER is now able to parse
          hexadecimal numbers, ESTRING is now able to search for multiple
          characters as the end of the string.

        * Added non-standard and non-portable facility codes (range 10-15),
          decouple syslog-ng facility name information from the system used
          to compile syslog-ng on.
