3.0.1
        Wed, 24 Dec 2008 12:16:08 +0100

We are happy to announce that version 3.0 of the syslog-ng Open Source Edition
application has been released. The news and highlights of this version are
summarized below:

NEWS:

        Communication:
        * Version 3.0 of syslog-ng supports the new syslog protocol standards
          developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The details
          of these protocols can be found at
          http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-syslog-protocol-23.txt
          and
          http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-11.txt.
        * The capability to encrypt log connections using TLS has been added.

        Configuration:
        * Log statements can be embedded into each other, making it possible to
          design complex log paths. That way for example the results of a filter
          can be sent to multiple destinations, or it can be sent to a
          destination unchanged, and partly rewritten for the other destination.

        Log files:
        * The encoding of source files can be set for proper character
          conversion (internally syslog-ng represents every message in UTF-8).

        Log messages:
        * The syslog-ng application assigns a unique message identification
          number to every log message, making it easy to detect if any messages
          are lost.
        * The syslog-ng application can read, process, and rewrite structured
          messages (e.g., Apache webserver logs) using templates and
          regular expressions. Both messages with fixed field sizes and fields
          separated with delimiters (e.g., comma-separated values) are
          supported.
