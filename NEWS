3.4.0alpha1

	Features:
	=========

	* Support for junctions & channels were added, which improve the
	  flexibility of the syslog-ng configuration language. This allows
	  combining sources with their closely tied processing functionality
	  (like parser, rewrite and filter statements). Read this blog post
	  for more information:

	    http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2012/01/syslog-ng-flexibility-improvements/

	  In the final form of the functionality the "log" keyword as
	  described in the blog post above was replaced with "channel".

	* The functionality to query and manipulate sets of name-value pairs
	  (often referenced as value-pairs and used in the mongodb()
          destination driver and the $(format-json) template function).
	  got significantly improved. It is now possible to change the name
          of the keys when creating the output. See this commit for more
          information:

	    https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/ddc7c2539bd66fa35e8df441e4baf58e87b6708d

	* Plugins & modules are now demand-loaded automatically if the
	  "autoload-compiled-modules" global variable is set to 1, which is
	  the default. Any shared libraries found on the module search path
	  is considered for loading if the configuration file contains a
	  reference to a functionality it provides.

	  To disable this functionality simply set the referenced variable
	  to 0 with a "@define" statement and load modules explicitly via
	  "@module" statements.

	  To list the available plugins & modules, use the --module-registry
	  command line option for syslog-ng, which results in a detailed
	  listing.

	* Added a new parser named json-parser() to parse incoming JSON
	  formatted messages. See this commit for more information:

	    https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/e5569687bba2551c89a78faee55bcf8b4944066f

	* Added a number of template functions:

	   $(length ARG)               - length of a template expression
	   $(substr ARG START [LEN])   - substring of a string
	   $(strip ARG)                - remove white space from the start and end
           $(sanitize ARG1 ARG2)       - join args to form a filename while
	                                 removing special characters like '/'
	   $(+), $(-), $(*), $(/), $(%) - perform numeric operations

	* Added support for replicasets to the mongodb() destination driver.

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/a980b9d268efa54879d3deeb4a53fa5a281629ba

	* Added support for safe-mode() to the mongodb() destination driver
	  that ensures inserts were properly executed at the cost of some
	  performance penalties.

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/768f0c6ec8eba2ad51531f2331fb5635fe12c063

	* Added support for SMTP destination to send out emails triggered by
	  log messages.

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/404ceb959efe9715ce7437d7dcdc28ababbac590

	* Added support for generating UUIDs via the $(uuid) template
	  function.

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/a16798c653c057239236945034114d8abf320e44

	* Added the @SET@ parser to db-parser().

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/ab08c84abbeda5a200b8150a6af7b02c64d84994

	* Added support for dbd-option() in the sql() destination driver
	  that makes it possible to supply driver specific options to the
	  DBI driver.

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/9254fe9e6236746bf1f955f0cac1274634b1beda

	* Reload of the configuration can now be triggered using 
          "syslog-ng-ctl reload".

	* A new macro named $LOGHOST was added, which expands to the local
	  hostname running syslog-ng.

	* A set of time macros were added prefixed with "C_" that use the
	  current time instead of the reception time (prefixed R_) and and
	  the time that was included in the message (prefixed S_).  This
	  means that C_DATE expands to the current date, whereas R_DATE
	  would expand to the date the current message was received at.

            https://github.com/bazsi/syslog-ng-3.4/commit/c2d17009e2ce14960acb519750fe2537b05e6f46

	* Improved error reporting by including the configuration-file
	  location of the object associated with the error. This makes it
	  easier to diagnose errors even in the case of otherwise unnamed
	  objects.

	* This release also includes all fixes of the 3.3 branch, which are
	  not listed here for brevity's sake. The merged commit ID is:
	  bf742b0, which is a couple of patches ahead of "3.3.4".
