3.3.0alpha1
	Sun, 06 Feb 2011 17:30:51 +0100

	This is the first alpha release of the upcoming syslog-ng OSE 3.3,
	containing the following noteworthy changes over syslog-ng OSE 3.2.

	Features:
	=========
	* Added mongodb() destination driver to insert messages into
	  MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

	* Uses multiple threads for message reception and output for
	  scalability over multiple CPUs/cores.  To enable multiple threads
	  use threaded(yes) in the global options section of your
	  configuration file.

	* Uses epoll() instead of traditional poll() for increased
	  performance, using a thin abstraction layer implemented in the
	  ivykis library. A copy of ivykis is available in the source tree
	  of syslog-ng.

	* loggen was made multi-threaded and added the ability to open
	  several connections, instead of only one.

	* Other performance related tweaks.

	Important changes:
	==================
	* log_iw_size() is divided among all possible connections for a
	  connection oriented transport like unix-stream(), tcp() and
	  syslog(transport(tcp)). This is in contrast with earlier versions
	  which shared the same window for all connections. At the same time
	  the global log_iw_size()/log_fetch_limit() settings were removed.

	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* This release is synced with syslog-ng 3.2.2 bugfix-wise.
