3.3.0alpha2
	Thu, 10 Mar 2011 12:51:36 +0100

	Features:
	========
	* Support for systemd activation added.

	* Add support for customizable token delimiters in "pdbtool
	  patternize", which makes the resulting patterns to have much
	  better quality.

	* Added support for a --no-parse command line option for "pdbtool
	  patternize" to avoid parsing the input as normal syslog messages.

	* Added a new flag 'ignore-errors' to LogWriter based destinations
	  (file, pipe, tcp, udp, syslog)

	* Added support for specifying the suppress() option globally.


	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* Fixed a tcp()/udp()/syslog() destination driver issue that caused
	  aborts during startup.

	* Handle non-epollable devices like /dev/null normally by failling
	  back to the regular file-like handling. Earlier these caused an
	  abort inside ivykis.

	* Makefile fixes to make it possible to compile syslog-ng from a
	  "make dist" tarball.

	* Added error messages about libdbi initialization failures, that
	  would prevent the SQL destination from working.

	* Make it possible to compile against PCRE not in a standard
	  location (caused compilation failures on FreeBSD).

	* Fixed several $(grep) related bugs:

	  - not to cause a segmentation faule when the filter expression
	    supplied contains syntax errors

	  - the template parsing code removed quotes required by filter
	    expressions, with the current change it is possible to use
	    quotes in the filter expressions directly:
               $(grep ('$username' == 'root') $MSG)

	  - fixed the handling of template function invocations within
	    correllation that had multiple messages in its context.

	* Fixed a segmentation fault in pdbtool match --debug-pattern in
	  case there was no matching rule.

	* Fixed "pdbtool test".

	* Added a new macro named $CONTEXT_ID that expands to the current
	  context-id in correllated rules.

	Other changes:
	==============
	* Changed the default syslog-ng.conf version number to 3.3 to match
	  the current version.

	* The pipe() destination used to override the default value of
	  flush_lines() by explicitly setting it to 0. This behaviour has
	  been removed, now the pipe() driver will properly use the default,
	  unless overridden explicitly.

	* Ported the 3.2 linking changes to 3.3, which means that:

	  - libsyslog-ng-patterndb.so is gone, both the command line pdbtool
	    command and the patterndb plugin (libpatterndb.so) links its
	    contents statically, to improve portability on Cygwin.

	  - unit tests & command line utilities link properly in
	    --enable-mixed-linking mode

	* Added debug messages in the correllation code to make it easier to
	  debug correllation rules.

	* Added debug/verbose options to pdbtool.

3.3.0alpha1
	Sun, 06 Feb 2011 17:30:51 +0100

	This is the first alpha release of the upcoming syslog-ng OSE 3.3,
	containing the following noteworthy changes over syslog-ng OSE 3.2.

	Features:
	=========
	* Added mongodb() destination driver to insert messages into
	  MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

	* Uses multiple threads for message reception and output for
	  scalability over multiple CPUs/cores.  To enable multiple threads
	  use threaded(yes) in the global options section of your
	  configuration file.

	* Uses epoll() instead of traditional poll() for increased
	  performance, using a thin abstraction layer implemented in the
	  ivykis library. A copy of ivykis is available in the source tree
	  of syslog-ng.

	* loggen was made multi-threaded and added the ability to open
	  several connections, instead of only one.

	* Other performance related tweaks.

	Important changes:
	==================
	* log_iw_size() is divided among all possible connections for a
	  connection oriented transport like unix-stream(), tcp() and
	  syslog(transport(tcp)). This is in contrast with earlier versions
	  which shared the same window for all connections. At the same time
	  the global log_iw_size()/log_fetch_limit() settings were removed.

	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* This release is synced with syslog-ng 3.2.2 bugfix-wise.
