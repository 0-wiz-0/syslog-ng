2.1beta1
	Fri, 18 Apr 2008 18:00:59 +0200

	Bugfixes:
        * Fixed a possible SIGABRT crash if the hosts file passed to
          dns-cache-hosts() had multiple entries with the same IP address.
        * Fixed a bug that caused the persistent DNS cache (e.g. /etc/hosts)
          to be reloaded for all name resolution requests.
        * Fixed a possible crash during startup if "-g" was specified without
          using "-u".
        * Fixed handling more than 256 destinations by changing the
          reference counter type of LogMessages to a 16 bit value.
	* Fixed door initialization on Solaris, the door portion of
          sun-streams() sources did not work in previous releases.
	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault in handling file
          sources that are marked optional and the source file does not
	  exist.
	* Fixed the LinkSys style timestamp parser to avoid recognizing
          hostnames starting with numbers as the year value of the
	  timestamp.
	* Fixed the year recognition heuristics as the older used the
	  previous year in some cases when the client's clock was too fast.

	Other changes:
	* Backported end-of-message search algorithm from PE, which results
          in increased performance and the removal of vague interpretation
	  of messages that contain both NUL and NL characters.
	* Removed destination files from the set of polled fds, they are
	  always writable anyway and cause performance degradation when a
	  lot of destination files are managed.
	* Fixed some FreeBSD and AIX portability issues.
	* Added the BSDTAG macro, implementation by Jung Christian.
	* Changed the reconnection logic in the TCP destination driver to
	  reattempt connections for any kind of network problems. Therefore
	  an unknown DNS name will not prevent syslog-ng to start up with an
	  initialization error.
	* Changed the file write error handling logic to suspend writing to
	  a file destination on write errors, but retry it some time later.
	  This time interval is controlled by time_reopen() just like with
	  other drivers.
