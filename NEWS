News for the 1.9.1 release
	Wed, 22 Jan 2003 12:13:44 +0100

	This release is still not intended for production use. It has a good
	number of new features and a couple of them may not be stable
	enough.

	New features:
	* template declarations, the possibility to define a template once
	  and refer to it
	* flow controlled log paths work, and they are also configurable
	* supports RFC3339 timestamps with second fractions and time zones,
	  time zone conversion & source time zone specification
	* MARK messages are generated
	* keep alive for connections as well as listeners
	* the ability to follow log files as they are written to
	* the possibility to mark parts of a message using standard '(' and
	  ')' regexp operators and refer to matches within templates (either
	  filenames or content)

	This program is still ALPHA.


News for the 1.9.0 release
	Thu,  9 May 2002 20:01:11 +0200

	This release is the first release of the new reimplementation of
	syslog-ng. I moved to using glib instead of libol, as glib is more
	mature and provides several nice & easy to use features.
	
	Here's a bunch of nice things about 1.9.0:
	* supports flow controlled log paths (still not possible to
	  configure it, but the code exists in the core)
	* better support for macros (macro support is moved out of affile,
	  thus any other drivers may use it)
	* more robust detection of closed destination sockets (a closed
	  channel is immediately detected, not at the first write) This
	  avoids losing a log message when the connection is broken.
	* supports respawning destination programs (should be used with care
	  to avoid DoS situations). This makes it easier to integrate third party
	  extensions to syslog-ng. (SQL backends, on-line log analysis etc)
	* performance improvements, instead of using linear lookup in linked
	  lists, I use hashtables everywhere.
	* the ability to define unparsed sources, makes it easier to
	  integrate things like Apache logs
	* many internal reorganizations to make it easier to implement things like 
	  hashed log files, SSL protected TCP sessions and so on.
	  
	Things still missing:
	* there are some new features with no configuration interface
	* internal messages always go to /dev/stderr
	* Sun's STREAMS is not yet supported
	
	1.9.0 is currently in an ALPHA state, it's been tested only on my
	development computer, and not real-life traffic.
