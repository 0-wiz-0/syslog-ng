3.5.0beta1
        Thu, 19 Sep 2013 11:03:15 +0200

        This is a BETA release of the syslog-ng 3.5 development
        branch, with a lot of internal rework and even more new
        features included. Being a beta release, testing is most
        appreciated, but running it in production is not advised.

        The release contains all the fixes from the 3.4 branch, the
        changes below are relative to the 3.4.3 release.

        Major Features
        ==============

        Multi-line support
        ------------------

        A major feature in the 3.5 release is the inclusion of support
        for multi-line messages, a feature that has been available in
        syslog-ng PE for a good while.

        With this, both indented and regexp-based multi-line support
        becomes available. For further information and examples, see
        the following blog post:
          http://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2013/09/05/what-is-cooking-in-syslog-ng-3.5/#f:multiline

        STOMP destination
        -----------------

        Joining the message-queue club, this new destination makes
        syslog-ng able to send events to any STOMP-capable message
        queuing server, such as Apache ActiveMQ.

        For further information about the destination, see this commit
        message:
          https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng-3.5/commit/82d19a4d4ad3f91e8214006f6ea7a47baabf48ef

        Template type hinting
        ---------------------

        While syslog-ng supported sending events to various datastores
        and queues for a while now (SQL first, MongoDB, JSON, and AMQP
        later), even if those supported other types of data, syslog-ng
        only ever sent strings.

        With template type hinting, it became possible to tell
        syslog-ng what type a certain template should be, so that the
        drivers can use that information in whatever way they see fit.

        This is currently implemented for the MongoDB driver only.

        For more information about type hinting and for examples, see
        the following post:
          http://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2013/09/05/what-is-cooking-in-syslog-ng-3.5/#f:type-hinting

        Other features
        ==============

        * in-list() filter: this new filter function allows one to
          easily implement file-based white- and blacklists with a
          simple syntax:

           filter f_white { in-list("/path/to/file", value("HOST")); };

        * You no longer need to remember how many zeros to put after a
          big number in the syslog-ng configuration file, you can use
          unit suffixes, such as:

           log-fifo-size(2GiB)

          See the following post for more details:
            http://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2013/09/05/what-is-cooking-in-syslog-ng-3.5/#f:unit-suffix

        * A set of new string-related template functions are
          available: $(uppercase STRINGS...), $(lowercase STRINGS...)
          and $(replace-delimiter DELIMITERS NEW-DELIMITER TEXT).

          The first two do exactly what their names suggest, while the
          last one replaces all occurrences of any DELIMITERS within
          TEXT with the NEW-DELIMITER.

        * There is also a new $(env VARIABLE...) template function,
          which looks up the given variables in the environment. This is
	  similar to using backticks in the configuration file, however the
	  name of the environment variable with $(env) may contain macros
	  too.

        * Support for Linux 3.5+'s /dev/kmsg was added, and the
          system() source will automatically detect whether to use it
          over /proc/kmsg.

        * For every correlated message in patterndb, the
          ${.classifier.context_id} property is automatically set to
          the context-id attribute of the matching rule.

        Incompatible changes
        ====================

        * The replace() transformation function of value-pairs() was
          renamed to replace-prefix() to better reflect what it
          actually does. The old name remains as an obsolete alias,
          however.

        * The username() and password() options of the MongoDB
          destination were removed, they never did anything before,
          either.

        Miscellaneous changes
        =====================

        * The build system was completely redone, it is much faster,
          more reliable, and less verbose by default now.

        * Several systemd-related enhancements were made, including
          support for notification-based startup. This also means that
          when systemd support is compiled in, libsystemd-daemon
          becomes a new dependency.
