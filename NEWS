3.2beta1
	Mon, 11 Oct 2010 12:25:07 +0200

	New features since 3.2alpha2:
	* Added support for message correllation in db-parser. See the
	  relevant blog posts for more information:

	  http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/10/syslog-ng-correllation-updated/
	  http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/09/syslog-ng-correllation/

	* Added "pdbtool patternize", which implements automatic patterndb
	  generation from a sample log file.

	  http://gyp.blogs.balabit.com/2010/01/introducing-pdbtool-patternize/ 

	* Added template functions framework and some initial functions:

          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/09/introducing-template-functions/

	  The new functions are: $(echo), $(grep) and $(if)

	* Added support to process native syslog.conf file using the
	  syslogconf SCL plugin.

	  http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/09/syslog-ng-now-supports-the-syslog-conf-file-format/

	* Added support for comparison operators in filter expressions, e.g.
	  it is now possible to use "$FACILITY_NUM" < "5". String and
	  numeric operators are also provided, the same way as in perl.

	* syslog-ng now automatically detects if an incoming message is in
	  RFC3164 or RFC5424 format. This means that the syslog driver can
	  be used to process both.

	* Added pdbtool validation support, using the "pdbtool test --validate". 
          Requires an installed xmllint program.

	* pdbtool is now able to merge patterndb XML files recursively in
	  order to make it easy to use the results of the patterndb project.

	* db-parser() automatically assigns class-specific tags to messages,
	  this means that a message classified "system" will get a
	  ".classifier.system" tag in addition to storing the class in a
	  name-value pair named ${.classifier.class}

	* It is now possible to use multiple program name patterns for a
	  single ruleset in patterndb.

	* Added $(ipv4-to-int) template function to convert an IP address to
	  its numeric representation.

	Bugfixes since 3.2alpha2:
	* Fixed a possible infinite loop in "pdbtool test" in case
	  program/message was missing from the sample message.

	* SQL: revert don't require the current CVS version of libdbi

	* Don't report "this config file version is too old" multiple times.

	* Underscore and dash are assumed to be equivalent in plugin names.

	* Various memory leaks were plugged.

	Removed functions:
	* Removed the use_time_recvd() global and per-destination option,
	  deprecated since 3.0. Can be substituted with $R_ prefix in macro
	  names.

	Other changes:
	* Restructured the source tree in order to make compilations of
	  independent plugins easier and faster. Modules go to modules/
	  subdirectory, the core lives under lib/ and the main executables
	  go into syslog-ng/

	* SCL paths are determined relative to ${datadir} instead of
	  ${prefix} to make distribution packaging easier.

	* Pass -avoid-version when linking modules.

	* syslog-ng now requires bison 2.4, this is also checked by the
	  configure script.

3.2alpha2
	Fri, 06 Aug 2010 21:17:50 +0200

	The documentation of syslog-ng is not yet up-to-date with the new
        features introduced with this release.  Therefore for each feature
        below you can also find an URL containining the best known
        description what the given feature does.  These are not necessarily
        100% accurate, but should give anyone interested an idea how to
        start experimenting.

	Also, please note that although this is an alpha release, the bulk
        of the changes are in the configuration parser, so once your
        configuration was parsed properly and syslog-ng starts up, an almost
        unchanged code is processing it.  This means that this release
        should be good enough to start playing with.  And feedback about
        what kind of syslog-ng.conf parsing errors you encounter on
        real-life configuration files is more than welcome.

	New features:
	* Plugins: the new architecture replaces the old monolithic one,
	  all syslog-ng functionality is loaded from external plugins when
          needed. It is possible to write plugins to extend syslog-ng
          functionality in the following areas:
            - sources
            - destinations
            - filter expression
            - parsers
            - rewrite ops
	    - message format

          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/07/syslog-ng-contributions-redefined.html

	* The framework for a "syslog-ng configuration library" (aka SCL) a
	  collection of configuration snippets installed along syslog-ng,
	  simplifying the authoring of syslog-ng configuration files.

          http://git.balabit.hu/?p=bazsi/syslog-ng-3.2.git;a=commit;h=287993339599deac0442e26355c600b5aee63583
          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/07/syslog-ng-contributions-redefined.html

	* pdbtool match is now able to read a file containing syslog
	  messages and apply patterndb and a filter expression on the
          contents.

          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/07/patterndb-grep-on-steroids.html

	* pdbtool test is now able to perform pattern testing automatically
	  based on the supplied example log message.

	  http://marci.blogs.balabit.com/2010/07/pdbtool-test-and-pattern-database.html

	* Persistent state containing the current file position for file
	  sources is now continously updated during runtime, instead of
          updating it only at exit, which makes it much more reliable in
          case syslog-ng doesn't terminate normally.

        * Better syntax error reporting in the configuration file.

	  http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/04/syslog-ng-32-changes.html

	* Support for reusable configuration snippets, similar to macros
	  with parameters, named "blocks".

          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/04/syslog-ng-32-opened-experimental-blocks.html

	* Added a confgen plugin that includes the output of a program into
	  the configuration file, making it possible to generate
          configuration file snippets dynamically.

          http://git.balabit.hu/?p=bazsi/syslog-ng-3.2.git;a=commit;h=5248ef6c49ff3af0b3c896448360073606c9c7d7

	* Support for BSD-style process accounting logs via the pacct()
	  source driver defined in by SCL and the underlying pacctformat
	  plugin.

          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/07/syslog-ng-and-process-accounting.html

	* Support for explicit COMMITs in the SQL driver, this speeds up SQL
	  INSERT rate significantly if flush_lines() is non-zero.

          http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2010/04/explicit-transaction-support-in-sql.html

	* It is now possible to supply a filter to rewrite expressions and
	  only apply the rewrite rule in case the filter matches.

	  https://lists.balabit.hu/pipermail/syslog-ng/2010-July/014565.html

	* It is now possible to use multiple parser expressions in a single
	  parser object, similar to rewrite rules.

	* Added support for using the include statement from anywhere in the
	  configuration file, instead of only at top-level. Also introduced
          syslog-ng "global values" that can be defined and the substituted
          anywhere in the configuration file.

          http://git.balabit.hu/?p=bazsi/syslog-ng-3.2.git;a=commit;h=1203267c465256c99e622edf11e226301170f1c7
          http://git.balabit.hu/?p=bazsi/syslog-ng-3.2.git;a=commit;h=52098762f27cde059e8b8ecda67691df85364e6d

	* Default configuration file supplied as part of SCL.

	Incompatible changes:
	* syslog-ng traditionally expected an optional hostname field even
	  when a syslog message is received on a local transport (e.g.
	  /dev/log).  However no UNIX version is known to include this
	  field. This caused problems when the application creating the log
	  message has a space in its program name field.  This behaviour has
	  been changed for the unix-stream/unix-dgram/pipe drivers if the
	  config version is 3.2 and can be restored by using an explicit
	  'expect-hostname' flag for the specific source.

	Bugfixes:
	* Bugfix-wise 3.2alpha2 is equivalent to syslog-ng OSE 3.1.2

3.2alpha1
