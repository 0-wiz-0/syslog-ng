.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

NOTE: This file is not yet updated to syslog-ng 2.0, use the HTML documentation.

The configuration file for \fBsyslog-ng\fP

A message route in syslog-ng is made up from three parts: a source, 
a destination and filtering rules. 

.SH SOURCES

You can declare source statements using the "source" keyword:

source <sourcename> { sourcedriver params; sourcedriver params; ... };

Sourcename is an identifier you'll use to refer to this group of messages. 
Sourcedriver is a method of getting a given message. The following drivers 
are available:

* file <filename> - reads messages from the given file

* unix-dgram <filename> - reads messages from the given AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM socket (BSDi style)

* unix-stream <filename> - reads messages from the given AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM socket (Linux style)

* udp <ip>,<port> - network source using the UDP protocol. If you do not want to bind to a specific interface use 0.0.0.0.

* tcp <ip>,<port> - network source using the TCP protocol.

.SH DESTINATIONS

Destinations can be created using the destination keyword:

destination <destname> { destdriver params; destdriver params; ... ; };

* file <filename> - writes messages to the given file

* unix-dgram <filename> - writes messages to the given AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM socket (BSDi style)

* unix-stream <filename> - writes messages to the given AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM socket (Linux style)

* udp <ip>,<port> - network destination using the UDP protocol

* tcp <ip>,<port> - network destination using the TCP protocol

* usertty <username> - sends log to the given user's terminal

.SH FILTERS

You can create filters using the filter keyword:

filter <filtername> { expression; };

Where expression is a simple boolean expression. You can use "and", "or" 
and "not" to connect builtin functions. Functions can be one of:

* facility(list of comma seperated facility names)

* level(list of comma seperated priority nammes OR a range separated by "..")

* program(regexp to match program name)

* host(regexp to match program name)

* match(regexp to match program name)

Other functions are being planned. 

.SH LOG STATEMENTS

You can connect sources and destinations using the log statement:

log { source S1; source S2; ... filter F1; filter F2; ... destination D1; destination D2; ... };

Where Sx refers to one of the declared log sources, Fx one of the filters and 
Dx one of the destinations.

Filters are ANDed together.

.SH OPTIONS

You can specify several global options to syslog-ng in the options statement:

options { opt1; opt2; ... };

Where optn can be any of the following:

* mark(n)		set mark frequency to n seconds

* sync(n)		set sync frequence to n lines (can be overridden locally)

* long_hostnames(yes|no)	set long hostname generation on or off
