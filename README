This source distribution is going to be syslog-ng 2.0 once it is ready.
Instead of using a custom, generic I/O library, this release is based on
glib created by the Gnome project.

It currently supports the following features:
---------------------------------------------
- parses syslog-ng.conf, and creates the internal representation of the
  config file
- pipe/file sources
- pipe/file destinations (without macro support)
- UDP/TCP sources
- STREAM/DGRAM unix domain socket sources
- user destinations
- program destinations
- filters work

It currently leaks memory a lot, doesn't support HUP, and doesn't process
its command line arguments.
